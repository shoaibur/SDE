Interviewed for software roles at Google, Amazon, and Facebook
* Background: PhD from a top medical school in the US and BS from a non-US school.
* CS background: None; online courses (mainly for fun during the lockdown)
* Experience: 6 months in an Oil and Gas industry

**Google**:
Applied online in May and let a recruiter know whom I knew (not very well though).
* Phone interview (in June): One LC medium question related to binary search. I couldn't figure out that a binary search could be used. So, I went with a linear search approach. It took ~40 minutes for me to implement that linear/non-optimal solution. So, the interviewer didn't have time for follow-up questions like, improvement, complexity analysis, etc. As expected, I was not invited to the onsite. However, it was an eye-opening interview for me - I realized that SWE was not just fun to learn in 2-3 weeks.

**Amazon**:
Contacted a recruiter via LinkedIn and asked if they were looking for any SDEs. The recruiter replied positively and asked me to take an online assessment.
* Online assessment (in July): Two questions from AMCAT in 90 minutes. I did well. The recruiter also shared that the hiring manager was happy with my coding style!
* Virtual onsite:
  * Round 1: System design - A simple system (widely available on Youtube or in almost all system design resources). However, it was my first system design interview, and it did not go well. I was in the right direction, but couldn't manage the time well, so missed to discuss the most important parts of the system.
  * Round 2: Coding - A problem related to the heap data structure but not directly available on LC. I came up with multiple solutions and coded the optimal one; was able to answer follow-up questions. I guess it was the "bar-raiser".
  * Round 3: Coding - A problem related to the graph and was directly taken from LC (one of the island problems!). I didn't practice this but was able to come up with a solution. However, I couldn't code it. I would say this round didn't go well.
  * Round 4: Coding - A problem related to the topological sorting but not directly available on LC. The interviewer was looking for a specific way to solve, so s/he guided me in that direction whenever I was trying in my ways. Overall, this round was interactive and went well.
  * Leadership principles: They appear for the first half an hour in each round; they seem inarguably important for Amazon interviews.
* Offer: SDE I in September

**Facebook**:
The recruiter contacted me (perhaps s/he got my resume from another role I applied to).
* Phone interview (in August): Two questions in 45 minutes; both questions were FB tagged LC medium. They went "pretty good" according to the recruiter.
* Virtual onsite:
  * Round 1: Behavioral - Typical behavioral questions. At the end, a simple coding problem was given, which was straightforward to solve (FB tagged LC easy).
  * Round 2: Coding
    * Problem 1. A problem related to search in an array - not directly available on LC. The linear search approach was obvious but I was able to solve it with binary search, which was a bit tricky to apply but impressed the interviewer. 
    * Problem 2. Another array problem - directly from LC hard. Figured out the solution, but didn't have time left for coding.
  * Round 3: Coding - A problem related to sorting - not directly available on LC, but could be characterized as a combination of 2-3 FB-tagged LC medium problems. I did well.
  * Round 4: Distributed system design - Similar to Yelp system design, but not exactly the same. I did well but needed little guidance.
  * Round 5: ML system design - Similar to image classification, or at least, I formulated the problem as a classification problem. The interviewer was happy with my approach. S/he asked a lot of questions in between, and couldn't finish all the details in time. I would say my performance was okay.
  * Feedback from the recruiter: My coding skill was strong, and my system/ML designs were good, but the lack of experience was obvious in the behavioral round. (*To be honest, it was hard to address all behavioral questions only with grad school research experience; better to keep this in mind when interviewing for a senior position with limited experience*).

* Offer: E4 in December (took several months to give the offer because of E4 hiring freeze)

**Take home**
* Practice! Here is an example how practice could help! For FB's phone interview, I struggled a bit in the beginning to solve the first question and took ~35 minutes to finish (come up with a solution and write/analyze the code). So, we had less minute to solve the second question. Since we were running out of time, the interviewer said that I don't need to write the code, but tell how I would solve it. Fortunately, I practiced this problem (and studied related topics extensively), so I gave the solution approach within a minute. Then s/he asked if I could write the code. It took ~7 minutes for me to code and analyze. The interviewer was super happy and mentioned that it was "great"!
* Quality > quantity: I solved around 200 and 300 LC problems for Amazon and Facebook, respectively. I definately coudn't remember many of them, but dived deep into some important/interesting/company-specific problems. This helped me to grow the general knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
* For Amazon: Leadership principles are important. They may take more than 50% of the total interview duration.
* For Facebook: Most questions were pretty much similar to what are available in LC, specifically FB tagged, so practice them.
